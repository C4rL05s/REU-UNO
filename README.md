# Project 
Can you identify a user based on their Gait using Machine Learning?

### Description
This project is part of my first research experience as an undergraduate. The idea is to create an algorithm using a Random Forest Classifier(RFC) to authenticate a user based on his/her Gait patterns. This was done using accelerometer data collected from 12 users. I try using different locations for data collection such as a back-hip sensor and a right-ankle sensor.
