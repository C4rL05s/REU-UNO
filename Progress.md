# Progress

So far I have been able to correctly authenticate 62% of the 12 users in this investigation. At the moment I'm using the following features: 
  1. Mean
  2. Inter Quartile Range (IQR)
  3. Standard Deviation
  4. Skewness 
  5. Kurtosis
  6. Variance

Ideally, I want to achieve a 90%> accuracy rate for the Machine Learning algorithm.

# Final Update 

## Accuracy 

  I've achieved 90%> in the majority of the models. The files included in this repository include the models used to authenticate users. 

### Models 

  1. RFC (Random Forest Classifier)
  2. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) 
  3. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
