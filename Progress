# Progress
So far I have been able to correctly authenticate 62% of the 12 users in this investigation. At the moment I'm using the following features: 
  1. Mean
  2. Inter Quartile Range (IQR)
  3. Standard Deviation
  4. Skewness 
  5. Kurtosis
  6. Variance

Ideally I would like to achieve a 90%> accuracy rate for the Machine Learning algorithm.
